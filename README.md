# Book Search Engine

This application will allow users to compile all of their favorite books into one convenient place online! This app was originally created using RESTful API routes, and I was tasked with changing those routes over to GraphQL routes. Upon launching this application, a user will be allowed to search for books with help from the Google Books API. If they want to save a book, they will be told to sign up or login (which they can do from the NavBar). Upon signing up or logging in, the page will reset and the user may now save any searched book to their profile. Finally, the user can delete the book from their profile with the click of a button! In future updates, users will be able to re-add previously removed books to their profile.
