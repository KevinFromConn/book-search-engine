# Book Search Engine

This application will allow users to compile all of their favorite books into one convenient place online! This app was originally created using RESTful API routes, and I was tasked with changing those routes over to GraphQL routes. In it's current state, the app does work in that a user can search for a book and find that book, but I'm still troubleshooting the connection to GraphQL. As it stands now, users are not able to sign up or log in, but I will continue to work so that this app reaches full functionality soon! In addition to GraphQL, I used React to create the front-end of this app, and the Google Books API to provide results for books when searched.
