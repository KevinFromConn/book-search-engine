# Book Search Engine

This application will allow users to compile all of their favorite books into one convenient place online! This app was originally created using RESTful API routes, and I was tasked with changing those routes over to GraphQL routes. With help from my instructor, the application now works exactly as intended, but there are still some issues to work out in regards to deploying the application to Heroku. Once these final issues are worked out, the application should be 100% functional!

*The application is still being worked on, so the Heroku link currently does not work as it should
